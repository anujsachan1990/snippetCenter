Demonstrate how use of Data Structures and Algorithms which are generally associated to programming languages and not scripting languages can help better optimize coding in JavaScript.

### Binary Search
One of the primitive steps in moving ahead with alogrithms in searching across sorted arrays. I have added an option of binary seach with unsorted arrays for you !! (now that I sort it myself internally). Here is the Javascript Code that kickstarts our journey on Algorithms.

### Bubble Sort 
The first of the sorting algorithms the order of time complexity is O(n^2). The algorithm is the trivial way of sorting involving swapping of values per iteration. The default output is in is increasing order. The least efficient for high order inputs this is ideally the least preferred sorting algorithm.

### Linked List
Just another ADT (Abstract Data Type) that is one of our stepping stones as we move ahead with coding Data Structures in Javascript. While everyone debates over arrays being more efficient than linked lists on the scales of performance but linked list have their own plus points.Every coin has two sides... and well I prefer to look at the better side... so let your requirement decide which is the better side.  

### Quick Sort
One of the highly effcient sorts, with a time complexity of O(nlog(n)). The concept of pivot is hereby introduced. While there are multiple ways of chosing a pivot, we prefer to go for the central element as the PIVOT. It is in-place by implementation. By what is the best implementation of sort - Quick Sort is an Algorithm of Choice.

### Selection Sort
The Selection Sort is a very basic sort. It works by finding the smallest element in the array and putting it at the beginning of the list and then repeating that process on the unsorted remainder of the data. So basically we can say, this is the default way to sort. When nothing works GO FOR IT....  And when you opt for Selection Sort O(n^2) is what you end up achieving as the average case time complexity for high scale inputs. 

### Insertion Sort
Another in the list of O(n^2) algorithms. It is a simple Sorting algorithm which sorts the array by shifting elements one by one. While there are not many reasons apart from Time Complexity on which I prefer algorithms, insertion sort is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms (all three being O(n^2) time complexity algos). The reason being it is a stable sort (that it preserves th order of the elements post sorting) and is in place. Also it is adaptive, which means it reduces its total number of steps if given a partially sorted list. Thus has a better time complexity in the best case scenarios like when the input is already sorted.

### Merge Sort
One of the best in time complexity performance. Merge sort performs at O(nlog(n)) for all cases. The divide and conquer sort though can be the go to algorithm optimizing Javascript Sorting. Merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more be divided. By definition, if it is only one element in the list, it is sorted. Then merge sort combines smaller sorted lists keeping the new list sorted too.

### Binary Search Tree
One of the top ranks amongst the data types that we would be using in the course of learning data structures and algorithms in javascript. 

Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which each internal node "x" stores an element such that the element stored in the left subtree of "x" are less than or equal to "x" and elements stored in the right subtree of "x" are greater than or equal to "x". This is called binary-search-tree property. The basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree with node n, such operations runs in O(log(n)) worst-case time. If the tree is a linear chain of n nodes, however, the same operations takes O(n) worst-case time.

This is also the best way to understand how your Binary Search Works.

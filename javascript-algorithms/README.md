# Javascirpt Algorithms
Demonstrate how use of Data Structures and Algorithms which are generally associated to programming languages and not scripting languages can help better optimize coding in JavaScript.

### Binary Search
One of the primitive steps in moving ahead with alogrithms in searching across sorted arrays. I have added an option of binary seach with unsorted arrays for you !! (now that I sort it myself internally). Here is the Javascript Code that kickstarts our journey on Algorithms.

### Bubble Sort 
The first of the sorting algorithms the order of time complexity is O(n^2). The algorithm is the trivial way of sorting involving swapping of values per iteration. The default output is in is increasing order. The least efficient for high order inputs this is ideally the least preferred sorting algorithm.

### Linked List
Just another ADT (Abstract Data Type) that is one of our stepping stones as we move ahead with coding Data Structures in Javascript. While everyone debates over arrays being more efficient than linked lists on the scales of performance but linked list have their own plus points.Every coin has two sides... and well I prefer to look at the better side... so let your requirement decide which is the better side.

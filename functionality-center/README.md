# Functionality Center
Some of the code snippets of all that I have made as a part of my learning and experience. While some of these may include simple code segments, some of them are quick to use functionalities used in day to day front end projects. 


## Lazy Load and Adaptive Utility

### What is Lazy Load ? 
Lazy Load is delays loading of images in long web pages. Images outside of viewport are not loaded until user scrolls to them. This is opposite of image preloading. Using Lazy Load on long web pages will make the page load faster. In some cases it can also help to reduce server load.


### What is Adaptive Images ? 
Adaptive Images detects your visitor's screen size and automatically creates, caches, and delivers device appropriate re-scaled versions of your web page's embeded HTML images. 

#### Whats in the utility ? 
1. HTML and JS for the lazy load and Adaptive behavior are pretty simply to understand and extend.

2. The Lazy Load Implemnetation in JS has currently ,for the purpose of Demo, has been made for Desktop, Tablet, Mobile and Mobile Retina (2x) images. You can feel free to extend the work for Retina Desktop, Retina Tablets or any other viewport for your scope of implementation.

3. The Image is way down at the bottom (pushed by explicitly adding margin-top to demonstrate the working lazy load). Resize the screen or test against devices to view the Adaptive functionality.

4. When you try and test for Adaptive behavior, you would observe that the image changes with viewport. This is just example images. Adaptive images allow you to use different renditions of the same image. 

4. The placeholder URL for the image ("Empty URL" has been used here) can be replaced based on usage.
